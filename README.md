# 📍 Mapple Project

Mapple is a **social media web app** designed for **orienteering enthusiasts**. It allows users to share their **maps and tracks** with other runners, making it easier to explore, analyze, and discuss different routes and experiences.

This project was my personal challenge to develop a **full-stack web application** using the **MERN stack** (**MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js**).
